`InvalidAuthenticityToken` happens if you enabled `protect_from_forgery`
but does not handle token well.

In `appliction_controller.rb`

    protect_from_forgery

This will automatically include a security token in all forms and Ajax
requests generated by Rails. If the security token doesn't match what was
expected, the session will be reset.

In page `<head>`

    <%= csrf_meta_tags %>

Is basically fulfilling the same thing as hidden form fields but is there to give
javascript requests that aren't tied to a form an easy way of getting the token.

If you use the jquery-ujs library the content of that meta tag is automatically
added (as a request header) to any ajax requests made.

`jquery-ujs` add a ajax filter to append token to parameter

    // ajaxPrefilter is a jquery method
    $.ajaxPrefilter(function(options, originalOptions, xhr) {
      if ( !options.crossDomain ) { rails.CSRFProtection(xhr); }
    });

Note: Only HTML and JavaScript requests are checked.
See more about `ActionController::RequestForgeryProtection` in rails API.

### Conclusion

Always import `jquery-ujs` when enabled `protect_from_forgery`
And put `<%= csrf_meta_tags %>` in page head.
